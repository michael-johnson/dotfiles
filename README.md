# Dotfiles

This is how I manage my dotfiles on nix(ish) systems using the ideas outlined in [this Atlassian blog post](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

## Setup
Run the following command to configure a new system to use this dotfiles repository:

```bash
curl -Lks https://gitlab.com/michael-johnson/dotfiles/snippets/1913818/raw?inline=false | /bin/bash
```

## Usage

```bash
cnf <git commands>
```
